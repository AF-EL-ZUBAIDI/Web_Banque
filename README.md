# University Project: Local Banking Website
## Overview
This is a university project, which presents a local banking website designed to serve three distinct types of users: clients, employees, and administrators. 
Each user type has access to specific functionalities tailored to their role within the banking ecosystem. 
The project leverages a robust backend built with PHP and a PostgreSQL database, ensuring secure and efficient transactions and data management.

## Features
- **Client Access:** Clients can view account balances, transaction histories, and manage their personal information.
- **Employee Functions:** Employees have tools to assist with account management, customer service, and reporting.
- **Administrator Capabilities:** Administrators can oversee the entire banking operation, including user management and system-wide audits.
- **Secure Login System:** Each user type logs in through a secure authentication process, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
- **Dynamic Content Management:** The site dynamically updates content based on user interactions and database changes.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **PHP:** Utilized for server-side logic and rendering dynamic content.
- **PostgreSQL:** Employs an advanced open-source relational database for secure and efficient data storage and querying.
- **HTML/CSS:** Structures and styles the website's front-end presentation.


## Installation and Setup
1. **Database Setup:** Import the sprint2(1).sql file into your PostgreSQL database to set up the necessary tables and relations.
2. **Server Configuration:** Ensure your PHP and PostgreSQL environments are correctly configured. Modify the connect.php file to reflect your database connection parameters.
3. **Website Access:** Deploy the PHP files to your server's root directory. Navigate to index.php through your web browser to access the banking website.

## Running the Project
To launch the banking website, simply access the `index.php` on your local server. Ensure that the PHP environment is configured to connect to your PostgreSQL database as specified in `connect.php`.
